              Hello! My name is <span className="purple">Sebasti√°n</span>, and I enjoy creating and building things. 
              My interest in web development and understanding how it works was my first exposure 
              to programming. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              During my <span className="purple">Computer Science </span> 
              studies in the <span className="purple">University of Buenos Aires</span>, 
              I gained solid foundations in 
              <span className="purple"> math, data structures and algorithms</span>, 
              and programming in different languages and 
              paradigms, such as functional, imperative, and object-oriented. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Currently, I'm focusing on developing full stack web applications 
              with <span className="purple">React</span> on the frontend and 
              <span className="purple"> Spring Boot</span> on the backend, 
              and I am looking for my first job experience in the world of programming.
              <br />
              <br />
              Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
