              Hello! My name is Sebasti√°n, and I enjoy creating and building things. 
              My interest in web development and understanding how it works was my first exposure 
              to programming. During my Computer Science studies, I gained solid foundations in 
              math, data structures and algorithms, and programming in different languages and 
              paradigms, such as functional, imperative, and object-oriented. 
              Currently, I'm focusing on developing full stack web applications 
              with React on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend, 
              and I am looking for my first job experience in the world of programming.
